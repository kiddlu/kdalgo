If we need to use to stack to convert sequence A to sequence B, then we can use 
the following algorithm.

1.  push the first element in A into stack
2.  p points to the first element in sequence B
2.  while (sequence A not empty) {
        if (stack.top == p) {
            pop the stack
            p points to the next element in sequence B
        }

        push next element in sequence A into stack
    }

    while (!stack.empty && stack.top == p) {
        pop the stack
        p points to the next element in sequence B
    }

    if (stack.empty) {
        print YES
    }
    else {
        print NO
    }
