we push "EASY" to the stack, and we expect to get the following.

1. EASY: the original order
    the answer is: E*A*S*Y*
    pop the element immediately after you push it in, then you can get the 
    original order of the element

2. YSAE: the reverse order
    the answer is: EASY****
    don't pop the elements until you push all the elements into the stack, then 
    you can get the reverse order of the element.

3. ASYE:
    the answer is: EA*S*Y**

4. AYES:
    the answer is: impossible.
    if you want to get element Y, you should pop it immediately after you push 
    it in. If you only pop A before, then your stack is: ESY, when you pop Y, 
    the top of the stack is S, not E
