What's the maximum number of exchanges involving any particular element during 
selection sort? What's the average number of exchanges involving an element?

1. The maximum number of exchanges is N - 1. For example, the largest element is 
   in the first place, and the remaining elements are in ascending order.

2. Each swap will involve 2 elements, and there are (N-1) swaps when you perform 
   selection sort. So the average number of exchanges involving an element is 
   2(N-1)/N
