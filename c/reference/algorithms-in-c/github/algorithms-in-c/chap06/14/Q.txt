Is selection sort stable?

The default implementation (swap two element) is not stable. For example, if you 
have the following input data
    B b a c where a < b < c
after the first iteration, you may swap B and a, results in
    a b B c
the sequence is sorted, but the order of b and B is changed.

But you can however implement selection sort stable if you, instead of 
switching, insert the minimum value. But for that to be efficient, you should 
have data structure that support insertion in a low cost. Otherwise, you end up 
with quardratic complexity.
