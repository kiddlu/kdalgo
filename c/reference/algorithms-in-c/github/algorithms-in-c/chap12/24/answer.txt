Which symbol table implementation would you use for an application that does 
10^2 insert operation, 10^3 search operator and 10^4 selection, randomly 
intermixed? Justify your answer.

The most operation is the selection, so we need an implementation that could 
take fast selection. Of course it is the sorted one. But whether it is the 
sorted link list or the sorted array? If we use the sorted link list, we need to 
step from the first node to the required node. Then the complexity is O(n) in 
worst case, and O(n/2) in average case. But If we use the sorted array, we can 
use the array index to extract the required item in constant time. So we need to 
implement the symbol tale using a sorted array.
